Exploratory Data Analysis on Airline Passenger Dataset using Python
#  Airline Passenger Data Analysis (Mini Project)

##  Project Overview
This project is a beginner-level Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on an airline passenger dataset.  
The goal is to understand passenger details and flight status patterns using basic data analysis techniques.

This project was created as a **learning-focused mini project** while starting my journey as a Data Analyst.

##  Objectives
- Load and explore the airline passenger dataset
- Check for missing and duplicate values
- Understand data types and structure
- Analyze flight status distribution
- Perform simple statistical analysis
- Visualize key insights using charts

##  Dataset Information
- Source: Kaggle (Airline Passenger Dataset)
- Format: CSV / Excel
- Records include:
  - Passenger details (age, gender, nationality)
  - Airport and country information
  - Flight status (On Time, Delayed, Cancelled)

##  Data Cleaning Steps
- Checked dataset structure using `df.info()`
- Verified missing values using `df.isnull().sum()`
- Confirmed data types using `df.dtypes`
- Ensured dataset consistency before analysis

✔ No missing values were found  
✔ Dataset was clean and ready for analysis

##  Analysis Performed
- Distribution of flight statuses
- Average passenger age calculation
- Frequency counts of categorical variables
- Visualizations using bar charts

##  Key Insights
- Flight statuses are almost evenly distributed among **On Time**, **Delayed**, and **Cancelled**
- Average passenger age is approximately **45 years**
- Dataset required minimal cleaning
- Clear patterns can be observed using simple visualizations

##  Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data loading, cleaning, and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis environment

##  Project Files
- `airline_analysis.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `Airline Dataset.csv` – Dataset used for analysis
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🚀 Conclusion
This mini project helped me understand the **basic workflow of a data analysis project**, including:
- Data inspection
- Cleaning
- Analysis
- Visualization
- Interpretation of results

It serves as a foundation for more advanced data analysis projects in the future.
